"""
The analysis_module module contains functions that perform sets of related
or interdependent analyses using tools from with pybilt; this includes
 outputting data and generating plots when relevant. These are meant to
streamline the use of 'common' pybilt analyses by removing the need for the
 user to directly construct specific anaysis objects, e.g. using the BilayerAnalysis
 object.
